# BoogioDiagnosticApp
An iOS example application which exposes sensor data reported by Boogio through its Bluetooth Smart networking layer. Apple's CoreBluetooth framework is used to communicate with the hardware.

## Instructions
Pairing and networking code has all been implemented. This application is intended to be used as a template so it is only necessary to edit the ViewController.m and Main.storyboard files in order to change how the app looks and behaves.

Editing the other source files may cause peripheral connection failures or unpredictable behavior.
